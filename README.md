# Pentester Academy: JS For Pentesters

> Explanation of All the Payloads Used in [Pentester Academy's JS for Pentester Course](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=11)

Hi, In this post you will learn about all the payloads and reasons why chose such payloads.

**DISCLAIMER** I am not claiming only my payloads are performant or valid. If you have any better payload or better approach. Please open a pull request

So before beginning, I would like to tell you that to prevent detection. I have tried to create payload short and concise.

**NOTE** All the inject will be done in `url` query parameter
